            <ul>
                <li>Submit leave applications easily through a user-friendly interface.</li>
                <li>Track the status of their leave requests in real-time.</li>
                <li>Access their leave history and receive notifications about approvals or rejections.</li>
                <li>Communicate with faculty regarding any leave-related queries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe that by providing an organized platform for leave management, we can help students focus more on their studies and less on administrative tasks.</p>
